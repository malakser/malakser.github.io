okay
so this is my blog or something
I'll write about whatever I find interesting to write about
Not even (you can ask Steven)
I'll write about anything
it's 2:43am
I'll write about space gardens
  those are gardens in space
  rotating
  how plants grow in them
  how small they can be
    gardens, that is
  I thought about writing a simulation
    some plants modeled as L-systems
    subject to coriolis forces
I'll write about ideas for rich people
  for people who have too much money and want to lose it
  in an interesting way
...
What kind of vibe am I aiming for?
  Turluscent?
    Buckminster Fuller had this word "dymaxion"
      he was like dymaxion this, dymaxion that
      dymaxion car, dymaxion house, dymaxion map, dymaxion sleep
      something something "dynamic maximization"
        I believe he made it up after he came up with the word
        it just sounded cool
    Well I have my word too
    that word is "turluscent"
    what's turluscent?
    I don't know for sure
    I walk around and when I see something that looks turluscent
    ...
    turbulent & translucent
    opposite of turluscent would have to be
      laminar & opaque
    [tensegrity]
      cat trees
      arithmetic
so right now it's just a bunch of text in &lt;pre&gt; tags
I don't know how to do
the idea is, I'll put out a lot of unfinished stuff out there
And I'll come around and make it even less unfinished.
I'll put out unfinished stuff out there on the internet.
To create tension!
Tension on the internet 
  Yo, when I was a little kid... I had this dream
  There were two massive metal bodies moving apart
  and they were stretching this tiny fishing line.
  And it was accompanied by 
I'll experiment with the new forms of publishing written work
that can't work on paper
with internet you can
and this is really cool
[whole life to write first book]
[blah blah to write second]
...
Yo,
This site supports JavaScript
It supports it when you least expect it
JavaScript is my favorite esoteric programming language
I don't like how bad choices pile up on it
[designing systems that will have stuff built on top]
...
on structural text editors
  macros
the deal with lisp
The methodology of organization
  Premature organization leads to spurious abstraction
    rly?
